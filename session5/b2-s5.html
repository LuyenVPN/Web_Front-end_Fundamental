        Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American
        singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting,
        artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading
        figure in popular music and the subject of widespread media
        coverage, with a vast fanbase known as Swiftles.
        <br />
        Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country
        singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2000) and Fearless (2008).
        The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You
        Belong with Me" found crossover success on country and pop radio
        formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic
        on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop
        with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny
        inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums
        contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never
        Ever Getting Back Together". Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad
        Blood" and "Look What You Made Me Do",
